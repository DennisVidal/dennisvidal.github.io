    descriptions:
        - "Banking is a mod for the game DayZ that, as the name suggests, adds a banking system to the game. It consists of ATMs that players can interact with, allowing them to safely deposit a certain amount of money before heading out or withdraw some when they want to gear up at a trader."

    role-descriptions:
        - "As the developer of the mod, I worked on every part of it. Since it was essentially my first mod for DayZ, this required a decent amount of time, as I had to familiarize myself not only with the modding side of DayZ's Enfusion Engine but also figure out aspects that I had relatively little hands-on experience with at the time, for example, the networking required to get the mod to work in multiplayer."
