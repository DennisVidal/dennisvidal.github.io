        icon: "fas fa-code"
        description: "C++ and C# have been core aspects of my degrees, allowing me to gather substantial theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience with both languages. I constantly refine this knowledge further through personal projects, and consequently, I can not only write clean, performant code but also have the ability to debug code to resolve any issues that could arise."

        icon: "fas fa-computer"
        description: "Unreal and Unity were the basis for the majority of projects during my academic studies, and since my graduation, Unreal has been the focus of my personal projects. Together with the experiences I amassed through creating mods with DayZ's Enfusion Engine, I am well-versed in working with game engines and able to quickly familiarize myself with any components that might be required."

        icon: "fas fa-gamepad"
        description: "Thanks to my degrees and my passion for and years of playing games across many genres, I have an excellent understanding of game mechanics and other fields beyond just programming, such as game design, animation, modeling, networking, and UI. As a result, I can approach projects with a well-rounded perspective and design components in a way that is beneficial to the team as well as the player experience."
    
    -   name: "Teamwork"
        icon: "fas fa-users"
        description: "Working with people has always played a significant role in most of my projects, be it collaborating directly in a team to finish a game or giving and receiving feedback in regards to decisions and design. Supporting my mods over the years has been especially helpful in regards to further improving my team-related skills, as I got to work with people with vastly different backgrounds and skill sets. Combined with my general game development knowledge, I can work efficiently with teams across multiple disciplines."

                    <p>
                        I'm Dennis, a game developer from Bavaria in Germany. While I'm sort of a generalist programmer, my focus and expertise
                        lie in the creation of immersive gameplay that is both intuitive and fun for players. I've always had a passion for
                        games and have been playing them since my early childhood, which led me to pursue both a bachelor's and a master's
                        degree in the field. Whenever I don't work on projects in my spare time, I mostly either play games with some friends or
                        catch up on anime, manga, and novels.
