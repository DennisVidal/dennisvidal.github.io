            -   text: "Compulsive Hoarding is a serious game meant to support the treatment of various hoarding disorders by utilizing the immersive nature of virtual reality. It is the result of a collaboration between a group of seven students and four psychologists."

            -   text: "The game has the patient dispose of hoarded belongings and slowly empty out their cluttered apartment. This happens while their psychologist monitors the progress via a separate interface so as not to interrupt the experience. This interface allows the psychologist to switch between different views and configure both the amount of objects that have to be cleaned as well as how flooded the rooms are in the beginning."

            -   text: While I am usually involved in the programming-related aspects, I chose to be responsible for the models and the environment in this project. For one, because I was one of the few members that was confident enough in their modeling knowledge to work on these parts, and for another, because I wanted to improve in these areas anyways at the time. Having said that, apart from an artistic role, I also ended up having a significant hand in the design and quality assurance of the project. This includes:"

                    -   text: "<b>Creation of models:</b> I was one of two artists on the team and, as such, worked on many of the game's assets. That includes all of the outside terrain, most of the furniture, and about half of the items that fill the rooms. Even though working primarily on assets allowed me to practice my artist skills, it made me realize that I prefer and am much better at programming."

                    -   text: "<b>Research into immersion:</b> Since compulsive hoarding was part of a serious games lecture, we were additionally required to write a paper on a related topic. The topic I chose was immersion in games, as it is fascinating and the paper was the perfect opportunity to do some deeper research on it. I completed most of the paper rather early in the development of the actual game, and as such, was more or less the go-to person when any question regarding immersion emerged."

                    -   text: "<b>Debugging implemented systems:</b> Since I usually finished all of my tasks early, I took on additional tasks and spent the end of most iterations helping the team by not only debugging the mechanics they implemented but also checking the game for any issues that might have been overlooked."

                    -   text: "<b>Working with external stakeholders:</b> Another major part of the project involved working together with a group of psychologists to include wished-for features. Working with them and incorporating their knowledge and feedback into the game's design was an interesting and valuable experience that ensured that the game's mechanics had the intended effect on patients."

                    -   text: "<b>Time management with Scrum:</b> To support the management of the project, we utilized Scrum as throughout the entirety of its duration. Having used it on multiple projects before this one, it was easy for me to incorporate it into my workflow and helped immensely in both managing my time and prioritizing certain tasks."
