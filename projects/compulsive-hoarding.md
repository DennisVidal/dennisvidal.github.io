descriptions:
    - "Compulsive Hoarding is a serious game meant to support the treatment of various hoarding disorders using the immersive nature of VR. To achieve this, I and six other students worked together with a group of psychologists to provide a tool that they could effectively use in the treatment of their patients."
    - "In the game itself, the user has to dispose of a configurable amount of items, all while a psychologist can monitor their process via a separate interface. While this might sound simple to most, it can prove quite challenging for patients to throw away even common items, depending on the severity of their disorder."

role-descriptions:
    - "While I am usually involved in programming, I chose to be responsible for the models and partially the environment in this project, as I was one of the only students that was willing to work on these parts, and I wanted to improve in these aspects anyway at the time. Having said that, I ended up helping a significant amount in both the design and quality assurance of the project as well."
