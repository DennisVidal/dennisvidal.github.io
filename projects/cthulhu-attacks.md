            -   text: "Cthulhu Attacks is an AR shooter in which you have to fight off Cthulhu and waves of his minions. The project is the result of a collaboration between myself and four other students. After initially scanning the play area, you are faced with dynamically appearing portals from which Cthulhu's minions emerge. To fight them off, you can switch between multiple spells using voice commands, and once enough of his minions have been defeated, Cthulhu emerges to face you himself. To deal with his attacks, you have to either dodge them or use the environment as cover."
