descriptions:
    - "Fast Travel is a mod for the game DayZ that aims to give players a somewhat immersive way to teleport between predefined locations using boards that can be placed around the map. Players can choose between markers on these boards to quickly travel to the configured areas. Both the cost of traveling and the areas themselves are highly configurable and can be set up to, for example, cut down on travel times between traders or allow players to access higher levels of loot in walled-off areas once they have certain items."

role-descriptions:
    - "As the developer of this mod, I worked on every aspect of it. Since the board model itself is part of DayZ, there wasn't really any artist work required in the mod's development. As such, my primary roles were the design and programming of the mod's systems. That includes the configurability of the locations and the actual fast travel system, which makes sure the player has the required items and takes care of the selection of a safe location and the teleporting of the player to this location."
    - "Since I created the mod more or less parallel to my banking mod, its development also required familiarization with DayZ's scripting language and the Enfusion Engine, along with working out the details of synchronizing everything properly in a multiplayer environment."
