descriptions:
    - "More Explosives is a DayZ mod that adds a row of explosives and a custom raiding system to the game. It is both an upgrade over the older Â <a href="/projects/Breachingcharge/Breachingcharge.html" target="_blank">Breachingcharge</a> mod and a highly configurable addition to DayZ's explosives. It uses DayZ's config and damage system as a base to allow for easier compatibility with other mods without having to potentially add custom code to get everything to work nicely together. Another improvement over the Breachingcharge mod is the ability to freely place charges on different surfaces, such as cars, giving players more freedom and options in dealing with different situations."

role-descriptions:
    - "Similar to Breachingcharge, the mod was primarily developed by my brother. Even so, I contributed significantly to the design, programming, debugging, and testing of the mod. That especially includes the network implementation that allows detonators to connect to multiple charges simultaneously and vice versa, all while keeping the synced information as compact and efficient as possible."
