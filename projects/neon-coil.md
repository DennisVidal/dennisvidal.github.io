descriptions:
    - "Neon Coil is a 2D arcade shooter that my brother and I developed within a span of two weeks with two primary goals in mind. The first was the creation of a sort of Unreal example for our portfolios, as most noteworthy university projects were based on Unity and therefore left us with little to show in regards to both our C++ and Unreal skills. The second goal was to familiarize ourselves more with a handful of Unreal's components that we hadn't worked with in depth before, including the Enhanced Input System, Niagara, Lumen, and Paper2D."
    - "The gameplay of Neon Coil combines elements from both Snake and Space Invaders to create a fun and intuitive loop. In the game, the player controls a snake-like ship with which they have to defend a city from incoming alien threats. The ship follows and shoots towards the mouse cursor and consists of one or more modules, each coming with their own type of weapon and adding to the overall length of the ship. The weapon modules additionally function as the ship's health and are lost either when hit by an enemy or when it runs out of ammo. Consequently, the player has to weigh picking up and using modules to manage the length of their ship, firepower, and health. The game is lost once the ship runs out of modules or when the aliens destroy the city's protective shield and invade."

role-descriptions:
    - "To fulfill the previously mentioned goals, I had a hand in nearly all aspects of the project. That includes the actual design and implementation of gameplay systems as well as artistic aspects such as Niagara effects, materials, and the overall look of the game. Some of the more noteworthy aspects I worked on include the enemies and items as well as the extendable system to spawn them, the ship controls and following of individual modules along the ship's approximate path without cutting corners, a modular ability system that is loosely based on Unreal's Gameplay Ability System, and the interface-based health and damage systems for both the player and enemies."
