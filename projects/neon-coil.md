descriptions:
    - "Neon Coil is a small project that my brother and I worked on over a span of two weeks to familiarize ourselves some more with a handful of Unreal's components that we hadn't worked with in-depth before, such as Niagara, Lumen, Paper2D, and the Enhanced Input System. The game mixes aspects of both Snake and Space Invaders to create fun and intuitive gameplay."
    - "The player controls a snake-like ship with which they have to defend a city from incoming alien threats. The ship follows the mouse, and the player can pick up different weapon modules to keep up with enemy waves. Each module adds to the length of the ship, and a module is lost whenever it is either used up or the ship gets hit. The player loses once their ship runs out of modules or the invaders break the protective shield and destroy the city."

role-descriptions:
    - "Since the goal was to learn how to work with certain components, I had a hand in nearly all aspects of the project. That, of course, includes not only the actual design and implementation of systems but also artistic aspects such as niagara effects, materials, and the overall look of the game. In regards to programming, some of my responsibilities included the enemies and items, as well as the spawning system for both of them, the ship movement and modules, and the health and damage systems. While I didn't exclusively work on certain other components, such as the ability system, I did dabble in essentially all of them and helped with their design and some implementation aspects."
